R1 questions 

Repeated start in i2c
Storage classes 
Const pointers 
Const
Volatile
Value of static and global and where it is stored
Spi 
I2c
Top halves
Bottom halves 
Interrupts
Struct vs union 
Typedef
Struct vs array 
Linkedlist traversal

R2

Tcs project 
Asked about arduino 
String reverse, with that asked in multithreading scenario - lock, global variable, generic for strlen 
( I took an example for “Hello” so the interviewer asked for generic length )

R3

Previous experience 
I2c in real time 
Real time issues of bus arbitration and clock stretching 
Who will do these 
I2c vs spi 
Volatile, const, const volatile 
Real time examples with sensor inputs how const and volatile and const volatile variables works )
